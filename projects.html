                    <p>This mobile-friendly application was made for a local non-profit pet shelter, PetHaven, that
                        educates, engages, and supports fundraising/revenue generation to help
                        make them more sustainable.</p>
                    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                    <p>This was my first experience implementing and using an API. In addition to the API,
                    I also gained more experience when it comes to working in a team that includes front-end
                    and back-end skilled members. This project really gave me insight on how it is to work
                    with a team in a professional setting as well as completing an application for a
                    client within a certain period of time.</p>

                    <p>This application aims to develop a simulation of single-core and multi-core systems
                        and scheduler for the cpu scheduling algorithms first-come first-served (FCFS),

                        job first (PSJF).</p>
                    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                    <p>I learned about how important time and team management is in a project. I had to
                    balance the team as well as being the Lead Developer. I had to learn how to deal with
                    difficult partners and expressing what I and the project required of them for us to
                    meet our goal.</p>
