                    <p>This application allows a user to search for movies and shows. The user can either
                        click the search icon or press the 'Enter' key which will search their input using the
                        OMDb API. When hovering over a selection, the application will display production year.</p>
                    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                    <p>From this project, I learned how to use the hooks useState and useEffect. In addition to
                        hooks, I also learned how to use onChange, onKeyDown, and onClick.
                    </p>

                    <p>This mobile-friendly application was made for a local non-profit pet shelter, PetHaven, that
                        educates, engages, and supports fundraising/revenue generation to help
                        make them more sustainable.</p>
                    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                    <p>This was my first experience implementing and using an API. In addition to the API,
                    I also gained more experience when it comes to working in a team that includes front-end
                    and back-end skilled members. This project really gave me insight on how it is to work
                    with a team in a professional setting as well as completing an application for a
                    client within a certain period of time.</p>

                    <h2>Everything Calculator<a href="https://github.com/mhaydel2/Everything-Calculator" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-github-alt"></i></a></h2>
                    <p>This application aims to develop a simulation of multiple-use calculators. There
                        is a finance calculator that tracks your transactions and an investment calculator
                        that calculates expected profit. The site allows a user to make an account and
                        store data inputs. Deployed using Heroku. Heroku's free service is no longer
                        available so the site is no longer active.</p>
                    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                    <p>This was my first time working in a team to deliver a full stack development project.
                        In addition, this was my first time using Django, using it with Python. I also
                        first learned how to use GitHub, and learned the importance of communicating with a
                        team about who is working on what issues in specific parts of the code.
                    </p>

                    <h3>CPU Scheduling</h3>
                    <p>This application aims to develop a simulation of single-core and multi-core systems
                        and scheduler for the cpu scheduling algorithms first-come first-served (FCFS),
                        round-robin (RR), non-preemptive shortest job first (NSJF), and preemptive shortest
                        job first (PSJF).</p>
                    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                    <p>I learned about how important time and team management is in a project. I had to
                    balance the team as well as being the Lead Developer. I had to learn how to deal with
                    difficult partners and expressing what I and the project required of them for us to
                    meet our goal.</p>
